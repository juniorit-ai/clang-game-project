## In this Session, Students Should Focus on the following Concepts/AI prompts to learn more.

### Linux Basic Bash commands

1.  I am new to Linux. Can you provide some basic Linux shell commands for practice?
2.  How can I list the files in a directory by their creation time using a Linux shell command?
3.  What is the purpose of the 'touch' command in Linux shell?
4.  How can I forcibly remove a directory using a Linux shell command?

### Learn some basic coding knowledge. 

5.  Please write a "Hello, World!" application in C?
6.  Does my program need the main function in C, and what is its purpose?
7.  How do I write single-line comments in C?
8.  How do I write multi-line comments in C?
9.  Does whitespace matter in C?
10. Do I need curly braces in C, and what is their purpose if they are needed?
11. Do I need to use semicolons in the end of each line in C?

## Basic Coding Concepts in C

### Section 1 : Comments in C

1. Single-Line Comments:

You can use double forward slashes (//) to write single-line comments in C. 

```c
// This is a single-line comment

int x = 10; // This comment is at the end of a line of code
```

2. Multi-Line Comments:

C also supports multi-line comments, which are enclosed within /* and */ markers. 

```c
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span across multiple lines.
  These lines are all comments and are ignored by the compiler.
*/

int y = 20;

/*
  You can also use multi-line comments to temporarily exclude code:
  int z = 30;
*/

int a = 40;
```
### Section 2 : JuniorIT.AI's special comments :

Starts with /*+ and ends with +*/, AI will ignore these comments automatically.

```

/*+
  Please follow these steps in the code editor to have AI complete the task for you:

  1. Without selecting any text, right-click to open the context menu and choose the "JuniorIT.AI: Do It for Me" option.
  2. Alternatively, highlight all the comments below, then right-click and select the same option from the context menu.
  3. As a third option, you can type all the requirements in a single line and then execute the command by pressing 'Ctrl' + 'Enter'.

  Once the code finished, please run shell command "jcscript discount-calculator.c" in the playground directory to test your code.

### Section 3 : `make` command

The Linux `make` command is used to build and maintain groups of programs and files from the source code.

- `make clean` :Cleans up the project directory by removing generated files.

```markdown {type: code}
make clean 
```
- `make` : Builds the project according to the instructions in the Makefile.

```markdown {type: code}
make
```
- `make run` :  Runs the built executable or launches the application.

```markdown {type: code}
make run
```
### Section 4 :

Here are some Basic Linux shell commands,

1. **pwd**: 
   - Stands for 'print working directory'.
   - Displays the full directory path of the current working directory.
  
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

2. **cd**: 
   - **cd** is the command for 'change directory'.
   - **cd ~/** navigates to the user's home directory.
   - **cd ../** moves up one directory level from the current directory.
   
   ```bash
   cd directory_path
   ```

3. **mkdir**: 
   - Short for 'make directory'.
   - Used to create a new directory in the specified path.
   
   ```bash
   mkdir <directory_name>
   ```
4. **rm file and directory**: 
   - **rm** stands for 'remove'.
   - Used to delete files and directories.
   - To remove a directory, the flag **-r** (recursive) is used.
   
   ```bash
   # For a file
   rm <file_name>
   
   # For a directory and its contents
   rm -r <directory_name>
   ```
5. **touch**: 
   - Used to create a new empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.
   
   ```bash
   touch newfile.txt
   ```


6. **ls -l**: 
   - **ls** is the command to 'list' contents of a directory.
   - The **-l** option lists files and directories with detailed information 

   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```

7. **echo**: 
   - **echo** is used to display text or variables to the terminal or to redirect it to a file
   - The >> operator is used to append the output of echo to an existing file (output.txt).

   ```bash
   echo "Additional content" >> output.txt
   ```
8. **gcc**: 
   - The `gcc` command is a compiler used in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, to compile and link C programs.
   - `source_file` : The C or C++ source code files that you want to compile. 
   - `-o output_file` : Specifies the name of the output file (executable) that will be generated by the compiler.

   ```bash
   gcc source_file -o output_file
   ```
